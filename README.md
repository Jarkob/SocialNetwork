# SocialNetwork
A social network built with php

This is a primitive and not well built social network with php.
The functions include:
- Create a profile
- Edit profile
- Add friends
- View friends profile
- Write posts
- Comment, edit, delete, like, dislike post
- add images, videos to posts (beta)
- write messages (ugly)

The data is stored in a MySQL database and I used MAMP to develop and run the application.
I highly doubt that anyone will draw use from this project but I learned a lot during it and have lots of good memories related
to it, so I will keep this repository.
If you are reading this, I recommend you do not look at the code.
